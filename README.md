# Start or Sit

**Start or Sit** is a web application that helps fantasy football players get quick and personalized **start/sit recommendations** for their weekly lineups.  

Enter 2–3 NFL players, and the app uses the OpenAI API to generate a recommendation on who you should start. Each user’s searches are tied to their account, making it easy to revisit past decisions and track trends over time.

- **Matchup Insights** – Offer projections and comparisons based on weekly opponents, weather, and Vegas odds.  
- **Team-Level Recommendations** – Suggest optimal lineups across multiple positions, not just player-to-player comparisons.
